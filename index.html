      <h1>Buddhism</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Due to the mixed language of homosexuality in Buddhist teachings they do not have a official view regarding the issue of same sex marrige but their is veiws for and against from both liberal and conservitiver stand points. For example Dalai Lama said “hey want me to condone homosexuality. But I am a Buddhist and, for a Buddhist, a relationship between two men is wrong. Some sexual conduct in marriage is also wrong.” but many buddhist orders say that they are wrong and that there is no buddhist teachings stating that homosexuality is unacceptable</h5>

      <h1>Christianity</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In Christianity like other religions their is two oposing views on the topic of same sex marrige. One view is that it is totally ok and there should be no hatred, hurtful comments, or any other form of rejection toward those who experience same sex attraction becasue all humans were created by god and should be treated the same. On the other hand there are people that believe that it is unethical and the bible/God prohibits it. In christianity it is about a 50/50 split on these views</h5>

        <h1>Hindu</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In Hindu there is both views on the topic of same sex marrige. Most believe that it is acceptable, as Amara Das Wilhelm writes in his book that everyone passes through various forms, genders and species and we should not judge each other by the material body but view everyone equally on a spiritual plane, and be compassionate that god is. He also stares that same sex lovers must have been cross lovers in a former life but also that marriage is a union of spirits and spirits are not male or female. But others believe that this is not ok and god forbids this.</h5>

        <h1>My View</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I believe that all people should be treated equally and not be discriminated because of they are attracted to the same sex. In some places places people are being hated on or even imprisoned because of this and I believe that this is unethical because we are all humans and should be treated equally because same sex marriage wasnt even an ideal back when most religious texts were written and people should’nt say that their religion is against it just becasue it dosnt mention it.</h5>
